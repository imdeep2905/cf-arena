# CP-Arena ðŸŽ®
A minimalistic platform to practice CP with your friend. Challenge your friend in ```1v1``` coding now :fire:!!!
## What does it offer?
After entering your codeforces handle you can either create or join the room. After both of the competitors join, we present five problems to you i.e. ```A(100 points), B(200 points) ... E(500 points)```. You can click on problem to view it on codeforces. Note that when you'll submit solution to problem on codeforces (and get **AC**) your score will automatically be updated. You can read detailed rules on the homepage.
## How we select problems for you ?
Firstly, to decide difficuly of problems we take average of both of your rating on codeforces. According to this average difficulties of five problems are determined. After this we just select random problems untill that problem is not attempted by any of you.
## What you need ?
All you need is an account on codeforces and an inner fire to beat your friend ðŸ˜†.
